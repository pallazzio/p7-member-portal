CatEmpire,active,Premium Member ,1999-02-11,2019-01-26,Cat Empire inc.,"The Cat Empire's origins are traced back to Jazz Cat, a Melbourne-based band, led by Steve Sedergreen in 1999.

Jazz Cat was a nine-piece group from different schools and backgrounds which debuted at the Manly Jazz Festival in Sydney. They gigged around Melbourne's jazz club scene including at Dizzy's (Sedergreen was a part-owner). Late that year, Jazz Cat spawned The Cat Empire, originally as a three-piece, with Ollie McGill on keyboards, Felix Riebl on percussion and vocals and Ryan Monro on double bass.

The band's name was taken from the title of a drawing by Riebl's younger brother, Max, and its distinctive cat's eye icon, known as ""Pablo"", was created by Ian McGill, Ollie McGill's father.

For a few months both groups performed alternate Thursdays at Dizzy's.

The Cat Empire's sound is a fusion of jazz, ska, funk, indie and rock with heavy Latin influences. They started playing a variety of gigs at other clubs including Bennett's Lane. The band expanded in July 2001 by adding Harry James Angus on trumpet, Will Hull-Brown (ex-Jazz Cat) on drums and Jamshid ""Jumps"" Khadiwala as a DJ on turntables (later on percussion).",http://kittyempire.org,2156549873,2151216565,cat@kittyempire.org,924 Walnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,1999,4,Harry James,Angus,2156549873,,harry.james@kittyempire.org,Trumpet,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Facilities,Electrical,Fire Protection,Insulation,Miscellaneous,Paving,Water Well Drilling,,,,,,,,,
